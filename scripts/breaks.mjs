// The breaks this repository knows how to perform, and what each one proves.
//
// One entry per invariant in `scripts/check-invariants.mjs`. Every check there
// is a claim that something in the tree holds; an entry here is the edit that
// makes it stop holding, so `pnpm break <name>` can demonstrate that the check
// is live rather than decorative.
//
// `CLAUDE.md`: *a break that does not go red is not evidence the check works —
// it is equally evidence the break did not land.* These are how that gets
// verified without anybody hand-editing a file and remembering to undo it.
//
// ## The shape of an entry
//
//   name     what `pnpm break <name>` is called
//   proves   the sentence a reader sees; what going red demonstrates
//   file     repo-relative, and it must be committed — `break-verify.mjs`
//            refuses on a dirty target because it restores by overwriting
//   find     the exact text to replace. **Must occur exactly once**, which the
//            harness checks before touching anything
//   replace  what to put there
//   command  argv, run from the repository root
//   expect   a string that must appear in the failing output, so a command
//            failing for an unrelated reason is not mistaken for a proof
//   build    true when the break only reaches the subject through a build, so
//            the harness rebuilds before the command and again after restoring
//
// ## Why the first entry is the only one that rebuilds
//
// `no-fixture-reaches-the-bundle` is a claim about `apps/frontend/dist/`, which
// no edit touches directly — the leak happens when a shipped source file
// imports a recorded body and the bundler pulls 357 kB of market data in behind
// it. So that break edits the source and the harness builds twice: once to make
// the leak real, once after restoring so the next command does not read a
// polluted `dist/` and go red for a reason that no longer exists.
