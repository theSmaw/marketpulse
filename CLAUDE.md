# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current state

**Pre-implementation.** The repository contains `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` and nothing else — no source, no package manifest, no git repo.

We are building this in **small iterations**. Do not scaffold ahead of the current step: build the thin slice that is asked for, keep it working, then move on. Do not add infrastructure (databases, workers, WebSockets, agent plumbing) before the iteration that needs it.

Keep this section, and the Commands section, updated as things actually land.

## Commands

None yet. Add build/test/lint/dev commands here as the toolchain is established, including how to run a single test.

## What MarketPulse is

An AI-assisted situational-awareness tool for US equities. It detects statistically unusual market behaviour and lets a human or an AI agent investigate it against primary-source evidence. `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` is the authoritative product definition — read the relevant section before implementing a feature.

It is explicitly **not** a trading system. It never predicts prices, recommends trades, or produces target prices.

## Non-negotiable architectural invariants

These are the load-bearing decisions. They are cheap to honour up front and very expensive to retrofit — treat a change to any of them as a design discussion, not an implementation detail.

**1. The LLM never calculates.** Every number a user sees comes from deterministic code (an analytical tool or service). The model chooses *what* to investigate and explains results; it must not produce figures from its own reasoning. If a feature needs a number the tool layer can't produce, add the tool — don't let the model estimate it.

**2. The AI manipulates typed application state, never markup or code.** Agent-driven UI changes are schema-validated `WorkspaceCommand` objects (`focusSymbols`, `openPriceChart`, `compareSymbols`, `setTimeWindow`, `pinEvidence`, …) executed against trusted, pre-existing components. No LLM-generated HTML, JSX, or executable frontend code, ever. Validate → permission-check → execute → record in investigation history.

**3. The product works with the AI switched off.** Every analytical capability must be reachable through direct user interaction. AI accelerates investigation; it is never the only path to a feature.

**4. Temporal isolation is enforced in the data/tool layer, not the prompt.** In replay mode, no component may read data timestamped after the replay clock. This constraint belongs in the data-access and tool implementations so future-information leakage is structurally impossible — never rely on instructing the model to behave. Design data access with this in mind from the first query, even before replay exists.

**5. Confidence and provenance are part of the domain model, not prose.** Findings carry an explicit confidence level — `CONFIRMED` / `SUPPORTED` / `POSSIBLE` / `UNKNOWN`. Evidence records source, event timestamp, retrieval timestamp, calculation method, and a raw-data reference. "Not enough evidence to explain this move" is a correct, first-class outcome, not a failure.

**6. Market-data provenance is displayed, never implied.** Alpaca's free tier is IEX, not consolidated SIP. The UI must label the feed (e.g. `Market feed: IEX`) and must not suggest full US-market coverage.

**7. Provider abstractions at the edges.** Market data sits behind a provider interface; the LLM sits behind an `AgentProvider` interface (`runInvestigation` / `streamEvents` / `cancel`). No vendor SDK types leak into the domain model.

## Domain model

The core objects, in dependency order — `Investigation` → `Step` → `Finding` → `Evidence`. An **Investigation is a persisted, first-class, long-running object**, not a chat session: it outlives any single AI response and has explicit status (`running` / `awaiting user` / `completed` / `failed` / `cancelled`). Steps have observable status so the UI shows real progress rather than a generic spinner.

The frontend renders investigation state from an ordered stream of typed backend events (`STEP_STARTED`, `TOOL_CALL_COMPLETED`, `FINDING_CREATED`, `WORKSPACE_COMMAND`, `INVESTIGATION_COMPLETED`, …) — never by parsing unstructured model text. This is what makes streaming, cancellation, retries, replay and testing tractable.

Anomaly detection is deterministic and deliberately interpretable: price percentile, volume ratio, relative move vs. sector and market, and breadth, normalised into a 0–100 score. **Every score must carry its explanation.** The score measures "how unusual is this?" — never risk or opportunity.

## Intended stack

React + TypeScript, Redux for domain state, RxJS for streaming pipelines and cancellation. Node + TypeScript backend (Fastify or NestJS). PostgreSQL, optionally TimescaleDB. Sigma.js/WebGL for the market topology, with the graph model kept separate from the renderer.

WebSocket for continuous market data; SSE/streaming HTTP for agent investigation events. These two streams have different semantics and stay separate.

Resist adding libraries before complexity demonstrates the need, and don't introduce a second database in V1 without a measurement justifying it.

## Frontend structure

Feature modules under `app/`: `market`, `topology`, `charts`, `anomalies`, `investigations`, `replay`, `filings`, `shared`. Modules expose domain-level APIs; they do not reach into each other's stores. Create a module when the iteration needs it, not before.

## Delivery order

Phases (spec §41): skeleton → live market → **deterministic investigation engine** → AI agent → generative workspace → replay → polish.

**Do not start with the AI.** The investigation engine, its analytical tools, and its event stream must work end-to-end without an LLM first. Only once the Investigation model feels correct should a model be allowed to drive it. This ordering exists specifically to prevent the architecture collapsing into `chat box → LLM → miscellaneous API calls`.

First milestone: display ~100 securities, receive live price updates, calculate an explainable anomaly score, click through to underlying price/volume evidence.

## Failure handling

Agentic failures are normal product states, not exceptions. Degrade incrementally and locally — a failed SEC lookup, analytical tool, or dropped market socket must leave the rest of the workspace and any already-gathered evidence intact and clearly labelled (e.g. "Live feed disconnected — displaying data through 10:42:17"). Never collapse to a global error screen.

## Performance targets

Measured, and published in the repo. Event → application state <250 ms p95 (excluding provider latency); 60 FPS at 500 nodes / 5k edges; >45 FPS in synthetic mode at 5k nodes / 25k edges; no routine main-thread task >50 ms; visible investigation feedback <500 ms after user action, streaming incrementally.

## Out of scope for V1

Brokerage integration, trade execution, portfolios, options, crypto, price predictions, buy/sell recommendations, social sentiment, news aggregation, real authentication, mobile UX, tick-level replay. Don't build toward these.
